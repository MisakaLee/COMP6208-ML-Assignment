# Dataset
The dataset is the "Activity recognition with healthy older people using a batteryless wearable sensor Data Set "
from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+recognition+with+healthy+older+people+using+a+batteryless+wearable+sensor

This data is originally from:
Roberto Luis Shinmoto Torres, University of Adelaide, roberto.shinmototorres '@' adelaide.edu.au

This dataset contains the motion data of 14 healthy older aged between 66 and 86 years old, performed broadly scripted activities using a batteryless, wearable sensor on top of their clothing at sternum level. Data is sparse and noisy due to the use of a passive sensor.

# Setup Environment
From inside /src run ".\env\Scripts\activate" then "jupyter notebook".
This will launch  the jupyter notebook in the browser.
