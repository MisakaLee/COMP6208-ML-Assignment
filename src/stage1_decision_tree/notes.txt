First attempt at decision tree algortim gave the following results:
	sit on bed precision: 0.9506024096385542
	sit on bed recall: 0.9772108000990835
	sit on chair precision: 0.933372992266508
	sit on chair recall: 0.8963153384747216
	lying precision: 0.9996372284251683
	lying recall: 0.9996372284251683
	ambulating precision: 0.8790322580645161
	ambulating recall: 0.7666240409207161

The predictions for ambulating are quite bad.

Including the rssi feature and normalising:
    sit on bed precision: 0.9470747517846886
    sit on bed recall: 0.9530179175955743
    sit on chair precision: 0.8634654324558866
    sit on chair recall: 0.8526135389888603
    lying precision: 0.9993148752669971
    lying recall: 0.999475996614132
    ambulating precision: 0.8704188481675392
    ambulating recall: 0.850383631713555

The recall for ambulating improved but many other measures were worse off.
